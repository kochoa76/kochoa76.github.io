Today was a day of reflection. Ok, maybe not just today, I would describe myself as a person who looks back often, not necessarily stuck in the past but more trying to learn from what's worked and what hasn't, with hopes of improving the present. Today, I'm in that kind of mood. 

I've embarked on quite a journey this past year. Having switched careers, learned an entirely new skill and way of thinking, never stopping and instead building on those skills day after day. I can feel my growth and feel how far I've come. 

However, like most humans, it's easy to focus on what's gone wrong, and what needs to be improved upon. For example, today I've realized it's been almost two months since I began my job hunt for a software developer position.  It's easy to come up with reasons why I've not yet accepted a job offer, but I've come to realize that doesn't make much sense at all. These past few months, I've improved my data structures and algorithms, learned Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB, and improved my technical interviewing skills. It's all a process and I try to remember that in my moments of reflection.    

I've decided instead to be proud of what I've done. A year ago I thought I could only ever be a person who worked in sales due to my background, and today I've added an entirely new, useful skillset to my repertoire. A year ago today I could only speak Spanish and English, much less Javascript, and Ruby... and so on. A year ago today I had not traveled the world and seen the many cultures, perceptions, and lifestyles as I have today. That is something. 

As I approach a new round of interviews this week, I reflect on how far I've come, and the person I've come to be. I'm a crazy hard worker, determined and borderline stubborn on achieving the goals I've set my mind to. I am compassionate, adaptive, empathetic, and resilient person. I'm curious, and a natural problem solver at heart. 

More importantly, I know what I want in this next chapter.  I am job hunting but I am also company hunting. I value the entire package -- culture, growth, product, team environment-- all of it, and I'm not willing to settle for less than what I'm looking for. 

If you've read this far, I hope this blog has brought some level of light to whatever challenge you may be facing, and maybe it might encourage you to reflect on your own goals this year.
