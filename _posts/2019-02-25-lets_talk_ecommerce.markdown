I've been diving into the world of Ecommerce recently. As I have mentioned before in this blog, I did created an Ecommerce app built using Rails/React/Redux that allows you to make purchases of beauty products. I began creating this app because of my interest in Ecommerce. 

Ecommerce has developed extensively, as software and online shopping has taken off, and to me, it's a very exciting world to learn about. There are a range of features Ecommerce platforms must offer today, and the more popular platforms provide an array of services ranging from providing Catalog API's to facilitate easier updates of products offered, to implementing a Cart API that makes it easy for retailers to view customer's carts and seamlessly offer discounts or coupons.  

For this blog I'd like to dedicate some time to reviewing particular features and offerings prevalent among Ecommerce Platforms. 

**POS Systems/ Order management Software**

To begin, I wanted to discuss POS Systems for retailers.  POS or Point- Of-Sale systems is what takes place between a merchant and a customer when a product or service is purchased. A point of sale system is the heart of a business and used for many essential tasks such as inventory management, labor reporting, menu customizations, price adjustments, staff management, sales reporting, customer management, marketing initiates, and so much more. The particular type of POS system will depend on the type of business being run. 


POS doesn't just involve software systems but also brick and mortar solutions in place in house. For example many POS systems integrate your online store to your brick-and-mortar solution to streamline inventory management, and prevent overselling. With inventory and sales data available, many POS systems can provide insight into velocity of goods (how quickly items sell), inventory tracking, sales analytics, and further provide insights into ways to minimize costs. 

As you can imagine, finding a POS system that is specific to your business is an important decision. 

Business owners must also consider what types of added features they will require in an Ecommerce Platform. Does your business require the ability to update your items frequently, or how about the ability to search for those particular items on your site? 

More importantly what kind of experience do you want to provide your users? Would you like your customer's to be able to log into your site using established platforms such as Facebook, Amazon, or G Suite? How about the ability to recommend certain products or services based on what your user frequently searches? 

Let's review these features in this next section of the blog. I've divided these Ecommerce features based on whether their services are tailored to the customer( i.e. assisting with user experience) or tailored to the retailer. 

**Retailer-based eCommerce Features**

In order to provide these trendy features for retailers, there are a range of API's provided by API creators that specialize in that given functionality. No need to code from scratch. 

Cart API - This feature is pretty awesome. It allows for retailers to be able to see which items a customer plans to purchase, and specifically, if a customer did not purchase that item, it allows for the ability to recover from that missed opportunity. Retailers can offer discounts for that particular item so that the user can convert. 

Payment API- Having a fully functional payment API is almost a necessity today. It alleviates many of the pains and manual aspects of processing payments, and many platforms even handle foreign currencies.  I go into the benefits of Stripe in my [previous blog](http://kaylaochoa.com/glowecommerce_add_ons). 

Price Comparison API - There are certain API's that allow a retailer to view what price point their particular item is selling at and use it as a way to price their item. 

Marketing Automation API- allows retailers to automatically add customers to email lists relevant to the purchases they've recently made, customer location, etc. 

Shipping API - integrates a shipping feature directly to your eCommerce site. Rates are automatically calculated, labels are created, and tracking numbers are generated.
