The day before Thanksgiving I graduated from Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development course. It was surreal to start. I finished something that I remember fearing might go unfinished when I signed up for the course.  It's funny how we assume the worst when attempting something new and scary.  I like to think of it as life's never ending joke. 

I did it, I graduated. Thanksgiving Day I was grateful, but shortly after I began to realize what was to come next. I got to the top of the mountain, I accomplished the goal I had set for 7 months only to find I had but arrived to the first resting spot, with an even higher mountain to next to climb, one with no end in sight. Life's never ending joke. 

Luckily, there was no turning back. I was excited about what I'd gained in attending a bootcamp and what I had ahead of me -- a job working on my craft everyday and contributing to something bigger than me. Filled with excitement and motivation, I jumped into the job search.  I quickly realized that although the structured lessons and labs provided by Flatiron were at an end, the learning and building were far from over. Not only could I not stop coding, but I also was required to create my own portfolio website (a daunting task in itself), start my next project, learn data structures and algorithms, continue working on code challenges, and begin networking and applying to jobs. It was a bit overwhelming to start. I'm very thankful to have had my bootcamp experience of learning on my own, and the diligence to take on new challenges. Additionally, I'm grateful for the support from friends, family, Flatiron coaches, and the developer community. 

I think it's important to remember there will never be an end in sight, and that's exciting. In my efforts to create a portfolio, take on new projects, and tackle challenging coding exercises,  I am growing and practicing resilience.  I chose a career where I will constantly be learning regardless of where I am in the process, whether I'm a junior or senior developer. And that is exciting. 

Something that does keep me hopeful in this job seeking process and a piece I'm learning as I expand my developer network is that it never ceases to amaze me at how helpful and responsive the developer community is. Coming from a background working in sales, it is very normal for sales people to be introspective. It's not a position that requires team work per se, as it requires you to attain a single revenue goal crafted for you based on your experience and assigned territory. Although you have a team of marketing and sales support, it is up to you to deliver and exceed your target revenue goal. Transitioning from a background in sales to development has been a pleasant surprise. 

Every single developer I've reached out to has responded to me with helpful advice. I continue to be amazed. I reached out to a friend of a friend who not only took an hour of his day to speak with me, but scheduled a follow up call one month later to check in on how I am doing. I reached out to 3 developers just yesterday, and all three responded remembering how difficult it was to find that first developer job, and agreeing to help me. I end my week with a gratitude and excitement to be a part of such an engaging and supportive community with the hope of being able to contribute the same for other developers.


















I. Finishing bootcamp, graduating, feeling the high and then immediate dread of the next mountain to climb. 
II. Overwhelm at working on coding challenges/whiteboarding + building next project + creating portfolio + applying to job 
III. Applying to jobs, realizing that may not be the best approach 
IV. Networking with fellow developers and realizing how incredible this new development community is.
