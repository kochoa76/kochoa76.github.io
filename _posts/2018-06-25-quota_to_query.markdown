Almost one year ago I quit my job at a tech startup in Boston. I worked there for four years, but in startup years, it felt like ten. I landed the job shortly after college as a sales rep, not knowing if I wanted a career in sales. However, after finishing a summer internship in sales post graduation, I figured my best chance of getting a job lied in sales. So after 4 years at Tulane University in New Orleans and a life mostly spent in the South, I packed my bags and moved to Boston. 

Like most recent graduates, life is shaky to say the least but for me adjusting to life in the North was no shortage of a struggle. With no central heat, an unfamothable rent, and, for a lack of a better word, *fiery* Bostonians--  I wasn't sure I'd made the right decision. On top of that, my job was tough. I was cold calling and emailing database admins, CIOs, and IT managers trying to convince anyone to take a meeting to learn more about my company's software. 

After about six months of working there, I became quite good at my job, and I started to realize my company was pretty cool. It was the typical startup -- shuffle boards,  nerf guns (*the bane of my existence*), catered lunches, happy hours, and lots of young people, albeit mostly men.  As the company grew (and it grew quickly), I was promoted to a few new roles within sales, finally closing deals and performing demos for clients. Although I had adjusted to working in sales, at this point in time, I still wasn't sure I wanted this for a career. I decided to make a deal with myself that if didn't enjoy my new role after working in it for one year, I would leave. It was a grueling year, I worked harder than I ever had at the company and the fruits of my efforts landed me as one of the top 5 performing reps in the company. 

It was December, and after all my hard work and an amazing year, I was at the top of the mountain, ready to look over to see what was on the other end as the new year began. However, when I got to the top and looked over to the other side, I found another mountain, but this time, it was double the height of what I had just climbed, and shortly beyond that lied yet *another* mountain and so on... 

That is sales. 

It's a never ending climb with stressful Marches, Junes,  Septembers and Decembers.  When you start the new year you start from the bottom, with zero dollars, but this time with an even *higher* quota than the year before. And so the years go, no matter what position you get to in a closing role. 

I was exhausted.  I kept finding myself asking "Is this it?" Most people would dream of having a job like mine, making a great salary, working at high-tech startup, in a great city (yes, I finally got there), but it wasn't enough for me.  Sales is a tough job, and I laud anyone who can not only perform the job, but also excel and *enjoy* the ups and downs.  I wasn't one of them, it took so much out of me and yet I felt like I wasn't doing anything at all. I came to the understanding that I wanted a job that challenged me, but in ways that incorporated creativity and brain power. I think everything clicked when I read an article somewhere about how there are really only two people in a company, those who build and those who sell.  I realized right then, I was on the wrong side. 

It took me a few months into the year to leave the company, but I have no regrets on what I'd learned not only within my role but also about myself. I learned that even though you may be good at something, that doesn't necessarily ensure success. Everyone has their own definition of success; some find it in achieving six figures on their W-2s, and others in finding meaningful work.  I'm still defining my definition, but I know so far, success is enjoying what I do everyday.  

Choosing to quit my job, and learning to code has been an exciting challenge and risk. I had always enjoyed coding, having played around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript throughout my sales career; however, I'd never thrown myself in to the level that I am now. It's been a shaky start, but I've learned to embrace the highs and lows that come with learning an entirely new language and skill.  In many ways, I feel grateful for my career in sales for preparing me for that.
