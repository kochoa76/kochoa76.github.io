My final project was definitely involved. I haven't ever made an Ecommerce related app before and I was intrigued by the idea of making one with React and Redux.  Although it wasn't easy it was a fun time learning how one would go about making an app for making purchases, adding to your shopping cart, and pulling product data from an API all in one. I now understand why React and Redux were made and it was an exciting process. 

There was a huge learning curve personally for Redux, not so much for React but both definitely a shift of mindset compared to the other languages we've learned. Even so, I feel like I could stick with these two languages for a while, as they not only involve Javascript but also lie in the front-end world. 

For Redux the key piece for me was to keep in mind that it is a tool to manage state and to leverage state in your app. Having to figure out how many items in a shopping cart there are for a given user at a given time while also renering a view is a tedious process to do solely with React and especially if it's a complex state to manage. As a result, Redux has definitely come in handy but not without a major learning curve. 

I am happy for the experience and looking forward to learning more related to both these tools as I add onto this project.
